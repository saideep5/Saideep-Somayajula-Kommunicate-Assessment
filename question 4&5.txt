Question-4
         The best project I ever worked on was developing a chat loop. I made it using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT. It is a chat window 
         where we can customize the font color of the message. It is a simple prototype for a word editor with multiple Functionality, along with it
         uses stack for multiple messages
         I considered it to be my best because learned so much while working on this project. I made a lot of mistakes while doing it, and did lot 
         of research while implementing it.

Question-5
    
     If I were to start a software company I would take my batchmates, Drashil and Shairan alongside me. Since in any company we
     need somone a team member who specializes in technology and development is crucial to your businessâ€™s success, especially for 
     tech startups. as well as someone who can be at Managerial Role of the company who can plan, organize lead to increase the 
     efficiency and effectiveness of our employees, processes, projects, and organizations as a whole. And most importantly who 
     is a team player
     In  my case, Darshil is someone who is very well verses at technical side and Shairan is someone who is good at the 
     managerial role.Since I have worked with both of them and I know their strength in their respective domain. Rather 
     than going for an unknown person with whom I haven't worked, I would like to hire people on whom I can put my faith
